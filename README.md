## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

**Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   `npm` or `yarn`
-   Git

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd PawsitiveMatch
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You will need to add your Google AI API key for the Genkit features to work.
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The app runs on two concurrent processes: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI server.

    -   **In your first terminal, run the Next.js app:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:9002`.

    -   **In your second terminal, run the Genkit development server:**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:watch
        ```
        This starts the Genkit toolkit in watch mode, which will handle the AI flow executions.

5.  **Open the app:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application in action.
